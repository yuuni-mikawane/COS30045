      Australia's Energy Net Export, Consumption and Production, 2014-2020
    </h2>
    <div class="explanation-text">
      <!-- <p>
        The overall Net Export and Production of energy in Australia has been on
        the rise in recent years. The Consumption rate seems to stay the same,
        barely fluctuated for the past 5 years. Notice how the amount of energy
        produced remained almost equal to the amount of Net Export and
        Consumption combined, it is reasonable to say that the planning for
        importing/exporting of Australia was stable, and barely any importing of
        energy was needed. The growth portrayed by the charts also mean that
        Australia's effort in managing and producing energy is proving to be
        effective, bringing in more money over the course of 5 years.

        The provided buttons switch between the detailed charts for each
        category of energy measurement, and a combined version of all categories
        for an overall view of the growth in recent years.

      <p>Click on the desired button corresponding to a chart to view them.</p>
      <p>
        While viewing the combined chart, you can toggle on or off for the
        Production line by clicking the
        <b>Production Visibility</b> button.

        Specifically for the combined chart, hover over the bars or a dot on the
        Production line to see the detailed number for that element.
